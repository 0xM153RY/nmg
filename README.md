# Normal Map Generator

This script generates normal maps from images using Python.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pillow
- Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installations)

## Installation

First, ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

Then, install the required Python libraries using pip. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
pip install opencv-python numpy pillow
```

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can run the script normally. It will provide a GUI for selecting an image to process.

## Note

Ensure that your environment is set up correctly with Python 3 and pip before installing these packages. If you encounter any issues, check your Python and pip versions and refer to the documentation of the respective libraries for further assistance.

## Running the Script

To run the Normal Map Generator script, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located. For example, if your script is in the 'Documents' folder, you can use:

```
cd path/to/your/script
```

3. Run the script with Python by executing:

```
python normal_map_generator.py
```

The script will open a graphical user interface. Follow the on-screen instructions to select an image and generate its normal map.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter errors related to missing modules, ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.
- Make sure you are running the script with Python 3.
- If the GUI does not open, check that Tkinter is properly installed and working in your Python environment.
